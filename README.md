A planetarium on your Garmin smart watch - shows positions of sun & planets in the sky, and a moving top-down views of the solar system from close, medium, and wide views.  Includes several of the largest asteroids & dwarf planets.  

It's a planetarium & naked-eye/binocular astronomy viewing guide on your wrist: What is up tonight or right now? at a glance.

Sunrise, sunset, moon phase, season - solstice, equinox - as seen from your location today and tonight, all viewable at a glance.  
Or dive deeper into planetary, dwarf planet, & asteroid motion in the Solar System in the years & decades ahead and past.

Watch tonight's sky, or the outer Solar System over the next 4000 years, unfold in beautiful animations and graphics.

The planetary motion model is based on algorithms from the sophisticated VSOP model of planetary motion for very good accuracy for visual and general observation purposes for hundreds and thousands of years into the past a future.  And you can view solar system, planet, and dwarf planet, positions with reasonable accuracy through tens of thousands of years into the future or past.

Using the [Greg Miller's VSOP Pico algorithm](https://github.com/gmiller123456/vsop87-multilang/blob/master/Languages/JavaScript/vsop87a_pico.js) gives [nearly all planetary positions 4000BC-6000AD within 1.2 degrees of actual position](https://celestialprogramming.com/vsop87-multilang/index.html) (and accuracy is far better 2125 +/-100 years).  Moving to the Nano algorithm was attempted and would improve accuracy by about 3X but takes a large amount of memory and runs far slower on today's smartwatches - perhaps in a future version!
