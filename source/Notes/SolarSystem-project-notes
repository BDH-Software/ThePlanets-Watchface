 TODO:

  - Add moon to solar system

  - Remove mode instructions as soon as any button is pressed

  - Different figures drawn in planets, as well as colors, like Sat/Jup.  Maybe X on all the planetismals & asteroids, all planets are full in w/ color. Asteroids could be one notch smaller than planets @ min

    FILL IN EARTH MARS MERCURY - COLORED BRIGHTLY.  But maybe a pattern also, so visible on BW disp

  4yrs - far dist SS
  2 yrs - outer, or 6 months, 1 yr on faster watch
   2 or 3 day - inner SS
   other modes OK
