Planet abbreviations:
Sun
Me Mercury
Ve Venus
Ea Earth
Ma Mars
Ju Jupiter
Sa Saturn     
Ur Uranus 
Ne Neptune     
Pl Pluto      
Er Eris (dwarf planet) 
Ha Haumea (dwarf planet) 
Ma Makemake (dwarf planet) 
Go Gonggong (dwarf planet) 
Qu Quaoar (ringed dwarf planet) 
Ce Ceres (dwarf planet/asteroid) 
Ch Chiron (ringed dwarf planet) 

This encompasses all of the Solar System planets and most of the larger dwarf planets.


TIP: Top-bottom of Large Circle are Solar Noon  Midnight (marks). 

TIP: Horizontal moving marks are the HORIZON - anything above them is visible in the sky. Moving upper mark is the MERIDIAN, highest point of the ecliptic at your location right now. 

TIP: The Large Circle represents the ECLIPTIC, the apparent path of the Sun & Planets across the sky.

TIP: Planet positions are accurate to 1.2 deg for the period 2000BC to 6000 AD.

APP TIPS: UP/DOWN or SWIPE Moves time forward/ back on the 1st screen. Otherwise, speeds or slows time. 

SELECT or TAP starts time if stopped,  otherwise, moves to next mode. BACK stops time if started, otherwise goes BACK one mode OR exits from the 1st screen 

TIP: The Solar System Orrery can run forward or back THOUSANDS of years. Try speeding up time to 10yrs then watch... 

TIP: Just opening the app gives a quick view of what's up tonight/right now. 

TIP: Auto Mode (FAST) moves time by 24 hrs so you can watch how planets move night to night 

TIP: Search for new moons, planetary conjunctions, etc.
